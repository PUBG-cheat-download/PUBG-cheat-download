PUBG Cheat is a cheat tool designed to enhance gameplay in PUBG, providing players with an unfair advantage. It includes features like auto-aim, wall hacks, and other exploits that bypass game rules.

**Key Features**:  
- **Auto-Aim**: Automatically targets nearby enemies, increasing shot accuracy.  
- **Wallhack**: Allows players to see enemies through walls, making them easier to spot.  
- **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)**: Displays additional information about enemy positions, health, and equipment.  
- **Speedhack**: Increases player movement speed beyond the normal limit.  
- **No Recoil**: Eliminates weapon recoil, making shooting more precise.  

**Ethical and Legal Considerations**:  
- **Game Integrity**: Using cheats undermines the fairness and competitiveness of PUBG.
